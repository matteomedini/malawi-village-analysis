# Elaboration on the analyses in the paper "Using wearable proximity sensors to characterize social contact patterns in a village in rural Malawi"

This notebook analyzes contact data within and between households in a village in rural Malawi.
The project was created during the internship at ISI Foundation and it aims to explore new approaches for analyzing contact patterns in village settings.
The data was collected by ISI Foundation, whose researchers provided the villageâ€™s inhabitants with contact proximity sensors.
In order to compute all the different analyses, I used the same methods and formulas as described in the paper, unless otherwise stated in the code. 


## How to Use
Run this on your terminal:
git clone https://github.com/matteomedini/malawi-village-analysis.git
cd malawi-village-analysis

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
2. Make sure the data is in the `data/` folder.
3. Run all the cells.
